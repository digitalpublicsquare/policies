# Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse Code of Conduct
## Introduction & Background 
Digital Public Square places respect and human dignity at the centre of its mission, and as such,  believes in the importance of preventing sexual violence, including sexual exploitation and abuse  (SEA). The purpose of this document is to articulate DPS’ shared commitment to preventing sexual  violence within the organization and programs by defining a code of conduct for the way that we  carry out our work and set out our expectations for all board members, full and part-time staff,  interns, and volunteers. 

DPS and has a zero tolerance towards sexual exploitation and abuse and child abuse. DPS takes  seriously all concerns and complaints about sexual exploitation and abuse and child abuse involving  DPS employees and related personnel. DPS also recognizes that sexual violence is rooted in power  imbalances, notably gender inequalities, and that these elements are still present in societies  around the world, including in Canada.  
## Definitions 
Sexual exploitation refers to any actual or attempted abuse of a position of vulnerability, differential  power, or trust, for sexual purposes, including, but not limited to, profiting monetarily, socially or  politically from the sexual exploitation of another. (U.N. Secretary-General’s bulletin on protection  from sexual exploitation and abuse)  

Sexual abuse refers to an actual or threatened physical intrusion of a sexual nature, whether by  force or under unequal or coercive conditions. ( U.N. Secretary-General’s bulletin on protection from  sexual exploitation and abuse)  

Consent: Sexual activity is only legal when both parties’ consent. Consent is defined in Canada’s  Criminal Code in s. 273.1(1), as the voluntary agreement to engage in the sexual activity in question.  The law focuses on what the person was thinking and feeling at the time of the sexual activity. 

Sexual touching is only lawful if the person affirmatively communicated their consent, whether  through words or conduct. Silence or passivity does not equal consent.  

Sexual harassment is mostly used to define a form of workplace discrimination through a conduct  or a course of vexatious comment that is known or ought reasonably to be known to be unwelcome  and creates a hostile or offensive environment. The Canada Labour Code defines sexual harassment  as any conduct, comment, gesture, or contact of a sexual nature that is likely to cause offence or  humiliation in the workplace ; or that might, on reasonable grounds, be perceived by that employee  as placing a condition of a sexual nature on employment or on any opportunity for training or  promotion.  

Protection from sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA) is a term used by the United Nations and  nongovernmental community to refer to measures taken to protect vulnerable people from sexual  exploitation and abuse by their own staff and associated personnel. (Source: Global Affairs Canada)  Sexual assault: Sexual assault is a legal term and constitutes a criminal offence. The Supreme Court  of Canada states that the act of sexual assault does not depend solely on contact with any specific  part of the human anatomy but rather the act of a sexual nature that violates the sexual integrity of  an individual. It includes being exposed to pornography or behaviors of a sexual nature (without  consent) or being filmed during intercourse (without consent).  

Sexual misconduct is an umbrella term covering a variety of problematic behaviours of a sexual  nature, including criminal and non-criminal conduct.  

## Core Principles 
DPS abides by the commitments outlined in the Inter-Agency Standing Committee’s (IASC) Six Core  Principles relating to sexual exploitation and abuse:  

1. Sexual exploitation and abuse by humanitarian workers constitute acts of gross misconduct  and are therefore grounds for termination of employment. 
2. Sexual activity with children (persons under the age of 18) is prohibited regardless of the age  of majority or age of consent locally. Mistaken belief regarding the age of a child is not a  defence.
3. Exchange of money, employment, goods, or services for sex, including sexual favours or  other forms of humiliating, degrading or exploitative behaviour is prohibited. This includes  exchange of assistance that is due to beneficiaries. 
4. Any sexual relationship between those providing humanitarian assistance and protection  and a person benefiting from such humanitarian assistance and protection that involves  improper use of rank or position is prohibited. Such relationships undermine the credibility  and integrity of humanitarian aid work. 
5. Where a humanitarian worker develops concerns or suspicions regarding sexual abuse or  exploitation by a fellow worker, whether in the same agency or not, he or she must report  such concerns via established agency reporting mechanisms. 
6. Humanitarian workers are obliged to create and maintain an environment which prevents  sexual exploitation and abuse and promotes the implementation of their code of conduct.  Managers at all levels have particular responsibilities to support and develop systems which  maintain this environment. 

## Employee Standards 
All DPS employees and related personnel must uphold the highest standards of personal and  professional conduct. This PSEA policy sets the minimum standards to be followed by DPS  employees and related personnel. 

1. Employees will not request any service or sexual favour from participants of DPS programs,  children or others in the communities in which DPS works in return for protection or  assistance and will not engage in sexually exploitative relationships. 
2. Employees will not exchange money, employment, goods or services for sex, including  sexual favours or other forms of humiliating, degrading or exploitative behaviour. This  prohibition against exchange of money for sex means DPS employees may not engage the services of sex workers while on DPS business, including on DPS premises or  accommodation, or while travelling to/from or attending workshops, meetings and trainings,  regardless of the local or national law concerning sex work or prostitution in the country.  
3. Employees must refrain from having sex or engaging in sexual activities with program  participants because there is an inherent conflict of interest and potential for abuse of power in such a relationship. If an employee engages in sex or sexual activities with a  program participant, the employee must disclose this conduct to his /her /their supervisor  for appropriate guidance. Failure to report such conduct may lead to disciplinary action  pursuant to DPS’ policies and procedures. 
4. Employees must refrain from sexual activity with any person under the age of 18, regardless  of the local age of consent, i.e. the local or national laws of the country in which the  employee works. Not knowing or mistaking the age of a child is not a defence.  
5. Employees will not support or take part in any form of sexual exploitative or abusive  activities, including, for example, child pornography or trafficking of human beings.  6. Employees must report any concerns or suspicions they have regarding possible violations  of this PSEA code of conduct via DPS established reporting procedures.  
6. Sensitive information related to incidents of sexual exploitation and abuse whether involving  colleagues, program participants or others in the communities in which DPS works shall be  shared only with enforcement authorities and DPS agents and employees of the appropriate  seniority or function who have a need to know such information. 

## Disciplinary Action 
Any violation of the Employee Standards will be considered as serious misconduct. Any proven false  accusations of SEA that are made maliciously can be deemed to constitute a violation of this code of  conduct. SEA concerns and complaints will be investigated and will be subject to discipline, which  may include termination of employment, removal from Boards or committees and possibly criminal  charges.
